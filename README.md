# Hi there! 👋 I'm Shazam Shakeel  

### 💻 Software Engineer | Full Stack Developer  

I’m Shazam Shakeel, a Full Stack Software Engineer with **4 years of experience** building high-quality web applications for startups and established businesses. I specialize in developing **eCommerce, SaaS, and enterprise platforms** that help companies strengthen their digital presence, simplify internal operations, and provide a better experience for their users.

Currently, at **360Solutions**, I am working at the intersection of Climate-Tech and Green Fintech. I'm helping high-impact platforms like Netto.eco, which helps banks manage real estate decarbonization, and Ducky.eco, a tool for automated ESG reporting. My work involves building the integrations and data pipelines necessary to turn climate science into practical, user-friendly software.

Previously at **Vintega Solutions**, I led the development of large-scale platforms for clients in the Middle East (KSA and UAE), managing a small team and helping improve performance, security, and customer engagement. I also designed admin panels, search systems, and analytics dashboards that enabled teams to make smarter, data-driven decisions.

I am passionate about creating products that are functional, visually clean, and focused on business goals. Whether I am optimizing site performance or automating a manual process, my goal is always the same: to help clients turn their ideas into reliable digital solutions that deliver real-world results.
